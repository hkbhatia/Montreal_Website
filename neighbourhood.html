						<td> <p class="neigh">Today, the city's oldest district, founded as a fur trading post in 1605 
						by Samuel de Champlain, is a mélange of shops, bars and sidewalk cafes that 
						attracts visitors and locals in equal measure. It's also become the hip place 
						to crash on a Montreal sojourn, with hotels like Le Petit Hôtel and the new 
						Hotel William Gray creatively adapting old buildings into cool places to stay.</p> </td>

						<td> <p class="neigh"> Life in the hip Plateau neighborhood revolves around the area's bars 
						and cafes and the leafy Parc la Fontaine, with its serpentine lakes and 
						albino squirrels. The neighborhood flanks the north side of Mont Royal and 
						McGill University. Gentrification has transformed the Plateau into an artsy, 
						upscale neighborhood where residents bike to work and school, "renaturalize" 
						their alleyways with murals and gardens and restore the wrought iron stairs 
						and colorful facades of their Victorian townhouses.</p> </td>

						<td colspan="2"> <p class="neighHead"> Mile End/Mile-Ex </p></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> <a href="img/neigh3.jpg" onclick="target='_blank'"> <img src="img/neigh3.jpg" alt="Mile End/Mile-Ex" class="oldImg" /> </a></td>
						<td> <p class="neigh"> Montreal's creative cauldron, Mile End is home to artists and writers, 
						musicians and filmmakers, as well as galleries, bookstores and entertainment 
						venues packed into an area that barely covers one square mile. Anchoring the 
						neighborhood, the neo-baroque Théâtre Rialto is a wonderfully restored 1920s 
						moving-picture palace that now presents a year-round slate of cabaret, comedy, 
						burlesque, dance, music and drama. As Mile End moves up the food chain, 
						many of the younger, edgier artists have migrated to adjacent Mile-Ex, 
						a former industrial zone now filled with ateliers and hipster hangouts. 
						The world of sci-fi owes a debt of gratitude to Mile End, for this is 
						the neighborhood that shaped the young Captain Kirk -- it's the place 
						where William Shatner was born and raised.</p> </td>

					<tr>
						<td> <a href="img/neigh4.jpg" onclick="target='_blank'"> <img src="img/neigh4.jpg" alt="La Petite-Patrie" class="oldImg" /> </a></td>
						<td> <p class="neigh"> Rather than having one distinct personality, this trendy neighborhood 
						just north of Le Plateau cultivates two totally different vibes. Chic shopping 
						is the main event along the Rue Saint-Hubert, home to more than 400 boutiques, 
						many of them one-off shops with unusual or offbeat items. But the neighborhood 
						also has a Latin flair, a delicious array of Hispanic eateries like the 
						Salvadoran Resto Los Planes (their pupusas are to die for) or the 
						Peruvian El Jibaro. </p></td>

						<td colspan="2"> <p class="neighHead"> Gay Village </p></td>

					<tr>
						<td> <a href="img/neigh5.jpg" onclick="target='_blank'"> <img src="img/neigh5.jpg" alt="Gay Village" class="oldImg" /> </a></td>
						<td> <p class="neigh"> Simply called "The Village" by locals, this compact neighborhood sprawls 
						along Rue Sainte-Catherine between the Plateau and the St. Lawrence River. 
						Once down and out, the area has morphed into a lively dining, drinking and 
						entertainment hub where more than 80 bars and restaurants serve the city's large 
						LGBT community and anyone else looking for an alternative night out. 
						"Gay Village is a great example of Montreal's neighborhoods continuing to 
						evolve," Thériault said. "A couple of decades ago, this was the city's 
						roughest area, the only place there was street crime. People shooting up, 
						prostitutes on the street corners, people getting mugged." </p></td>

						<td> <a href="img/neigh6.jpg" onclick="target='_blank'"> 
						<img src="img/neigh6.jpg" alt="Little Italy" class="oldImg" style="margin-bottom: 50%;" /> </a></td>
						<td> <p class="neigh" style="margin-bottom: 10%;"> Italians have been in Montreal for nearly as long as the French, 
						thanks to a 16th-century regiment recruited from northern Italy and sent to 
						reinforce the king's army in New France. By the 1950s, the area around 
						Jean-Talon Market was predominantly Italian and soon gained the moniker 
						of Little Italy. While the community revolves around the red brick Church 
						of the Madonna della Difesa (a national historic site), visitors flock 
						to the vibrant market to sample all sorts of gourmet foods and drinks. </p></td>
