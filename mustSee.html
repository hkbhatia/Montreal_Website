						<br /> <br />
						 Most high-rise construction in Montreal occurred in two periods: the late 1920s to the early 1930s and then from the early 1960s to the early 1990s. There are currently 42 buildings and structures in Montreal greater than 100 m (328 ft).

						<td> <p class="neigh"> The Biosphere is a museum in Montreal dedicated to the environment. It is located at Parc Jean-Drapeau, on Saint Helen's Island in the former pavilion of the United States for the 1967 World Fair, Expo 67. The museum's geodesic dome was designed by Buckminster Fuller.
						<br /> <br />
							In August 1990, Environment Canada purchased the site for $17.5 million to turn it into an interactive museum showcasing and exploring the water ecosystems of the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence River regions.
							<br /><br />
							The museum was inaugurated in 1995 as a water museum, and is a set of enclosed buildings designed by Éric Gauthier, inside the original steel skeleton. The Biosphère changed its name in 2007 to become an environment museum. 
							<br /><br />
							It offers interactive activities and presents exhibitions about the major environmental issues related to water, climate change, air, ecotechnologies and sustainable development.

						<td> <p class="neigh"> The Metro, operated by the Montreal Transit Corporation (STM), was inaugurated on October 14, 1966, during the tenure of Mayor Jean Drapeau. It has expanded since the 1960s from 26 stations on three separate lines to 68 stations on four lines totalling 69.2 kilometres (43.0 mi) in length, serving the north, east and centre of the Island of Montreal with connections to Longueuil, via the Yellow Line, and Laval, via the Orange Line.
						<br /> <br />
						The Montreal Metro is Canada's busiest rapid transit system, and North America's third busiest by daily ridership behind those of New York City and Mexico City, delivering an average of 1,254,700 daily unlinked passenger trips per weekday (as of Q4 2016).</p> </td>

The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts possess a varied collection of European, First Nations, Inuit, and Canadian arts, including important paintings from Montreal's own Betty Goodwin, James Wilson Morrice and Paul-Émile Borduas. The Musée d'art contemporain has concentrated its collection mainly to emerging post-war Quebec artists, with arguably some of the best artistic works in Quebec from Alfred Pellan and Jean-Paul Riopelle.
						<br /><br />
						Other praised museums are the Redpath Museum, the Stewart Museum, the McCord Museum of Canadian History, the Canadian Centre for Architecture, and the Montreal Museum of Archeology and History. </p></td>

						<br /><br />
						 Today André Bathalon, Yan Cordeau, Alexis Froissart, and Nicolas Munn-Rico work with half a dozen year round employees for LNDMRK, the artistic marketing agency behind the festival.  From PR, to wall finding, artist coordination, event planning, collaborations, and programming – the execution of the festival is a work of art in itself. </p></td>

						<td> <p class="neigh" style="margin-bottom: 15%;"> Atwater Market is a farmers' market located in the Saint-Henri area of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It opened in 1933. The interior market is home to many butchers and the Première Moisson bakery and restaurant. The outside market has many farmers stalls which sell both local and imported produce, as well as two cheese stores, a wine store specialising in locally produced spirits and a fish store. Quality is usually very good, although bargains are quite rare.
						<br /><br />
						The market's Art Deco building was designed by architect Ludger Lemieux, working with his son, Paul Lemieux. It is located on Atwater Street, near the Lachine Canal and the Lionel-Groulx Metro station, as well as Greene Avenue. A pedestrian bridge, which can also be used by bicycles, connects the market to Saint-Patrick Street and to a bicycle path in Pointe-Saint-Charles on the other side of the Lachine Canal.  </p></td>
